Let's try to implement those.\n\nI was surprised that nobody seemed to have uploaded any optics packages\nin opam. Sure, there are at least 3 or 4 lens libraries, but they don't include\nprisms. Some even have problems with their polymorphic lenses! As such,\nI've decided that it would be a very interesting experience to investigate how\noptics are implemented, and potentially upload the resulting library to opam\nfor everyone else.\nNo optics 101 are to be explained here. I expect you at least have a vague\nsense of the more basic types in the family (Iso, Prisms, Lenses and\nAffines/AffineTraverals or whatever they're called). If you want an\nintroduction to them, read this or this.\nNow, in order to implement optics in OCaml, I've decided to rely on an\nalternative representation to the usual two main and popular implementations -\nprofunctor optics and the van Laarhoven representation. Existential optics offer\na simple model, that does not rely too heavily on typeclasses compared to\nthe other representations (except in ad-hoc polymorphic composition, which we\ncan't do in OCaml anyways). It is also useful in order to understand how the other\nrepresentations are implemented.\nIsomorphic Optics\nLet us imagine a lens that takes a type s and extracts a part of type a out\nof it. Lenses need to be capable of doing that extraction, but also reversing it\nafter in order to update the original value. Unfortuantely, as currently presented,\nthat's not possible. Since a is only part of s, we need \"the rest of s\" to\nrebuild it off a.\nIn order to fix this, we can think of this operation as decomposition. We take s,\nand we decompose it into a pair of values of type (a,c), where c is \"the rest of\ns\". Thus, we have a mapping from s's structure to a,c, and a reverse mapping back to s... that's just an isomorphism.\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nAn isomorphism just states that two structures are only different in labelling,\nthat is, we can map to each of these structures in both directions as they have the\nsame structure anyway. Since our lens holds the mappings, it becomes proof of this\nrelation.\nEvery optic we'll make here has to hold this property, where the original type and\nthe \"focused\" part alongside some extra information, are equivalent up to an\nisomorphism. The type of this last value could very well be anything so as long as such\nproperty holds anyway, which is why these types of optics are called existential.\nUnfortunately OCaml doesn't really support existential types in the same way, say,\nHaskell does, so we need to make this c type explicit in our type signatures\n(this'll be a pattern by the way, sorry). Anyways, let's make a signature of our\nexistential lens type:\ntype ('s, 'a, 'c) lens = {\n  get : 's -&gt; 'c * 'a ;\n  set : 'c * 'a -&gt; 's ;\n}\n\n\nAlternatively, this could be done with modules, and that's what I've tried at\nfirst, but at the same time it doesn't change much.\n\nSo yeah, our isomorphism requires a mapping from s to a,c, and another that\ngoes back. Hence, two functions. set, over and view are relatively simple\nto build from here:\n(* Just get the value and extract 'a from it. *)\nlet view {get; _} s = s |&gt; get |&gt; snd\n\n(* Get the value and update the 'a component off ('a,'c), then go back to 's. *)\nlet over {get; set} s f = value |&gt; get |&gt; (fun (c, a) -&gt; (c, f a)) |&gt; set\n\n(* Just reuse over, where the modifying function just ignores its argument\n   and returns the value we want to update 's with. *)\nlet set lens s a = over lens s (Fun.const a)\n\nNow, Prisms. In case we can extract a from some value of type s, we can trivially\nmap s to a and viceversa. However, in case the operation fails, we need to\nconserve information (of type 'c) that allows us to rebuild it later. In the\ncase of a sumtype, it could be the very value it came from, so that when it is\nreverse mapped, we can return it directly.\nSo all we really have to do is use an Either type. It'll hold 'a when the\nfocus is successful, 'c otherwise, and with any of those values were can\nreconstruct how 's was like.\ntype ('s, 'a, 'c) prism = {\n  get : 's -&gt; ('c, 'a) Either.t ;\n  set : ('c, 'a) Either.t -&gt; 's ;\n}\n\nHere's preview and review in terms of this representation:\n(* Get the value, and map it to an Option type. *)\nlet preview {get; _} v = get v |&gt; function Left _ -&gt; None | Right v -&gt; Some v\n\n(* Reviewing just means to evaluate the \"successful\"\n   branch in the set function. *)\nlet review {set; _} v = Right v |&gt; set\n\nIso is very trivial in this representation. It is, quite literally, an isomorphism.\nThe types s and a are already expected to be the same structurally. Thus, no\nextra information to conserve, thus 'c's type here would be unit.\n(* In my implementation, 'c is not added though,\n   it is here for educational purposes. *)\ntype ('s, 'a, 'c) iso = { get : 's -&gt; 'a ; set : 'a -&gt; 's }\n\nAlso, the operations from and to_ are trivial to implement:\nlet from {get; _} = get\nlet to_ {set; _} = set\n\nLast but not least, affines (or better called AffineTraversal or Optional).\nAn affine type its has a structure like c + b x a. so, not only are we trying to\nfocus on a particular case of a sumtype, but also on a piece of a particular case.\nThat's kinda why you can call them a combination of prisms and lenses, as you're\nliterally combining the means of focusing on both a case AND part of the type.\nAgain, type representation breaks a bit in OCaml, because now we need to somehow\nsplit a type variable (the a from b x a) into two parts... and that's just not\npossible. So instead we pass three type parts into the constructor - a 'b type\nthat indicates the parts we need to \"track of\" in order to rebuild the original\ntype, and a type 'c that indicates all the possible failed branches:\ntype ('s, 'a, 'b, 'c) affine = {\n  get : 's -&gt; ('c, 'b * 'a) Either.t ;\n  set : ('c, 'b * 'a) Either.t -&gt; 's;\n}\n\nAnd the affine traversal's preview and over functions would implemented as\nfollows.\nlet preview {get; _} v = get v |&gt; Either.map ~left:(Fun.const None) ~right:snd\nlet over {get; set} f v =\n  get v |&gt; Either.map_right (fun (b, a) -&gt; (b, f a)) |&gt; set v\n\nAgain, it's kind of a combination of what we did with lenses and prisms. Of\ncourse, just if you squint a bit.\n\nDo notice that these type signatures do not necessarily require the types of\nthese optics to have s and a to be the same in the \"forward\" and \"backward\"\nmapping:\ntype ('s, 't, 'a, 'b, 'c) lens' = {\n  get : 's -&gt; ('c, 'a) ;\n  set : ('c, 'b) -&gt; 't ;\n}\n\ntype ('s, 'a, 'c) lens = ('s, 's, 'a, 'a, 'c) lens'\n\nThis is perfectly fine (it does change some type signatures, notably the\nfunction passed to over changes from a -&gt; a to a -&gt; b). It also\nmakes sense under our mental model of isomorphic optics - we are still\nconserving the same shape, we're just transforming the focused part into another\ntype.\n\nComposition Nightmare\nOf course, one of the beautiful things about optics is its high composability.\nThat means we don't need to make a very specific optic for every occasion, but\nrather we make one out of smaller parts. Neat.\nWhat's so neat is how this has to be implemented in OCaml. Again, no\ntypeclasses, no ad-hoc polymorphism. And in order to do composition in these types of\noptics, you still need typeclasses to infer the morphsisms required to fit the optics\ntogether. Therefore, we... quite literally need to make a function for every pair of\noptic types, manually (which must be ordered because the order of composition\nmatters).\nThey vary from being trivial:\nlet iso_and_lens\n  ({get=get1;set=set1} : ('a, 'b) iso)\n  ({get=get2;set=set2} : ('b, 'c, 'd) lens)\n  : ('a, 'c, 'd) lens\n  =\n  let get v = get1 v |&gt; get2 in\n  let set v = set2 v |&gt; set1 in\n  { get; set }\n\nTo:\nlet compose\n  ({get; set} : ('s1, 's2, 'b1, 'c1) t)\n  ({get=get'; set=set'} : ('s2, 'a2, 'b2, 'c2) t)\n  : ('s1, 'a2, 'b1 * 'b2, ('c1, 'b1 * 'c2) Either.t) t\n  =\n  let open Either in\n  let get s1 = match get s1 with\n    | Right (b1, s2) -&gt;\n        begin match get' s2 with\n        | Left c2 -&gt; left (right (b1, c2))\n        | Right (b2, a2) -&gt; right ((b1, b2), a2)\n        end\n    | Left c1 -&gt;\n        c1 |&gt; left |&gt; left\n  in\n  let set = function\n    | Right ((b1, b2), a2) -&gt;\n        let s2 = right (b2, a2) |&gt; set'\n        in (b1, s2) |&gt; right |&gt; set\n    | Left (Right (b1, c2)) -&gt;\n        let s2 = left c2 |&gt; set' in\n        (b1, s2) |&gt; right |&gt; set\n    | Left (Left c1) -&gt;\n        c1 |&gt; left |&gt; set\n  in\n  {get; set}\n\nYeah the functions themselves are all about making the types of the two composed\noptics and the resulting composition. The implementation is boring, so instead\nlet us talk about matching types. Although, the typing wouldn't be so hard if\nit were just about matching inputs with outputs. That is, if our intent is to focus on\nthe focus of another type, that's just making an optic out of the relevant subjacent\nfocuses/optics ('s1, 'a1, ...) t and ('s2, 'a2, ...) t. This resulting optic has\nthe signature ('s1, 'a2, ...) t. However, what should this unknown ellipsis be?\nIt depends. For Isos in relation to any other optic ('s, 'a, ...) t, all we're doing is either mapping 's and 'a to another type\n(depending on if we compose from the left or the right, respectively), so ...\ndoesn't need to change.\nIn the case of Lenses of type ('s, 'a, 'c) t, there are some patterns, but\nthey're hard to see if we do not look at some samples:\nval lens_and_prism :\n  ('a, 'b, 'c) lens -&gt;\n  ('b, 'd, 'e) prism -&gt;\n  ('a, 'd, 'c, 'c * 'e) affine\n\nval prism_and_lens :\n  ('a, 'b, 'c) prism -&gt;\n  ('b, 'd, 'e) lens -&gt;\n  ('a, 'd, 'e, 'c) affine\n\nObserve how, in the case of composing lenses from the left of another optic, we\nneeded to conserve 'c into the final optic by adding it to every possible\ndecomposition \"branch\". They can either be 'c * 'd (successful prism focus) or\n'c * 'e (unsuccessful prism focus). In the second case, as we compose the lens\nfrom the right, we just add a new part to \"keep track of\" in the resulting lens,\nwhich naturally results into an affine traversal.\nConversely, when we compose prisms from the right, we're adding a new possible,\nfailure branch to the optic, and any parts we were keeping track of in the\nsuccessful branch in the optic to the left have to be added to every branch.\nNow you're ready to understand why composing affines works the way it works:\nval lens_and_affine :\n  ('s1, 'a1, 'c1) lens -&gt;\n  ('a1, 'a2, 'b2, 'c2) affine -&gt;\n  ('s1, 'a2, 'c1 * 'b2, 'c1 * 'c2) affine\n\nval prism_and_affine :\n  ('s1, 's2, 'c1) prism -&gt;\n  ('s2, 'a2, 'b2, 'c2) affine -&gt;\n  ('s1, 'a2, 'b2, ('c1, 'c2) Either.t) affine\n\nAgain, remember that the third and fourth type slots in out traversal type indicate\nthe parts we keep track of any all failure branches, respectively. Then, in the\nformer case, all we're doing is adding the residual part of the lens to every\npossible branch in the affine, while in the latter case, we need to add the\nextra branch provided by the prism. Similar logic applies to every other case,\nmore or less.\nWe wouldn't really need to know all of this garbage if OCaml had existential\ntypes. At least the user can totally ignore all that, yes? They can just focus\non the first two types of any given optic, right...?\n\n  \n    \n    \n      That's not the entire type, by the way.\n    \n  \n\nI love types! : ) Anyways.\nNow that I brought up the user experience, let's talk about it.\nAgain, no ad-hoc polymorphism, so we can't just use one single operator for optic\ncomposition. As an alternative, a page was taken off reasonML and scala libraries,\nwhere they just do method chaining that quite literally describe the composition of\nwhich types are combined. We can simulate something similar, and also make it\nrelatively easy to type.\nEssentially, every composition function that takes two optics of a and b, and\ncomposes them in that order, has a signature of a -&gt; b -&gt; c. For each of those\nfunctions, an alias of two letters of type b -&gt; a -&gt; c is made.\nThe inversion of the input is intentional - they're swapped in order to\nfacilitate composition through piping. Here's a sample:\nlet some_optic = some_lens |&gt; la some_affine |&gt; ap some_prism |&gt; ai some_iso\n\nAnd so the letter to the left of the shorthand indicates what must be piped, while the\nletter to the right restricts the type of the optic to pipe into.\nThe Twist Villain\nNow, you might think we've escaped what probably was the worst part of this\nwhole project. Well, we kinda did actually, but not without yet another curve\nball!\nMaybe you want generic lenses. Say, lenses over the first component of a tuple\nof two elements:\nlet _1 = Lens.make\n  ~get:(fun (a, b) -&gt; (b, a))\n  ~set:(fun (b, a) -&gt; (a, b))\n\nThis doesn't really work because of OCaml's value restriction semantics. In a nutshell and in this case,\npartial application of polymorphic functions that only solve partially (that is, not\nall the type vars get resolved in compile time) become closures with weak types.\nThose get resolved by the compiler once the value gets used anywhere, and uses\nthe types that match that situation. Thus, this resulting type is not\npolymorphic in any way, which isn't what we want. We want to make our lens\ngeneric in the first place.\nHow do we solve this? Well, just force the lens to instantiate whenever you\nwanna use a new one:\nlet _1 () = Lens.make\n  ~get:(fun (a, b) -&gt; (b, a))\n  ~set:(fun (b, a) -&gt; (a, b))\n\nThis is an incredibly dumb but... I suppose, fine solution. Here's the lens at\nplay:\nlet _1_1_1 () = _1 () |&gt; ll (_1 ()) |&gt; ll (_1 ())\n\nSo yeah. You may check out the (as of 24/09/22) half-documented project in my\ngithub, here. I'll eventually add it to\nopam.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/optics-in-ocaml/","title":"Existential Optics and OCaml"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/pages/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/pages/","title":" "}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":9,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/optics-in-ocaml/":{"body":1387,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
